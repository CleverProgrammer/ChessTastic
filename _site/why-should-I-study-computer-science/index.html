				<h1 id="why-should-i-study-computer-programming">Why Should I Study Computer Programming?</h1>

<p>I want to cover this quite differently from how most other people might answer this question because I want to emphasize that money should not be your focus when decided careers. I mean don’t get me wrong, money is important, but what is even more important is what you actually are able to do for yourself and for others when you decide your career. There are a million and two reasons why you should study computer programming but let’s break it down into four simple ones.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-create-anything-you-want">1. You Can Create Anything You Want</h2>
<p><img src="http://initiontechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mobile_Apps.jpg" width="400" height="400" align="middle" />
At its core, computer programming gives you the ability to digitize your ideas. Imagine being able to actually implement any idea that you could think about! You know that idea you have for an awesome app that would go viral once it was released out into the wild… Yeah that one – you could actually create that yourself. Let’s face it, if you are like most people, you might not have a giant pile of cash stashed away to hire somebody to make that app for you because it can get very expensive, very quickly. On the other side let’s say you had some money put away in your account overseas in the Bahamas, it is very unlikely that the person you hire will implement your idea of the app exactly how you want. </p>

<p>Do you think Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook, would have ended up creating the same Facebook if he hired someone to do the work for him? Do you think that the hired developer would have ended up putting the same amount of heart and soul into the work as Mark Zuckerberg? Do you think if the person who came up with the idea of creating Twitter, if he did not have the ability to code, would Twitter still exist? The answer for both of these is probably a resounding “No!”. This is one good reason why you should learn how to program.</p>

<h2 id="instant-scalability">2. Instant Scalability</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.simicart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/secret-of-mobile-apps.jpg" alt="Scale Your Program To The World" width="600" height="400" align="center" />
There is nothing else in this world that can scale its problem solving capabilities to the rest of the world like software development or computer programming can. For example, if you create an application or a website that monitors someone’s heart-rate, lets them measure their caloric count, or tracks their spending, then all of a sudden hundreds of millions of people can have their fitness or finance related problems solved with the click of a button. You can use computer science to practically solve any problem! I mean think about Uber right… Someone had an epic idea and they set out to turn it into a reality. They set out to digitize their idea into a mobile application by using their computer programming skills. Once they had completed and published the app, it was downloadable by millions of users instantly.</p>

<h2 id="a-job-is-guaranteed">3. A Job is Guaranteed</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.lonestarpropertysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jobs2.jpg" alt="Computer Programming Job and Money Statistics" width="600" height="400" align="center" />
We are living in the digital age and the growth of technology does not seem to be coming to a stop. As a matter of fact, the use of electronic devices is growing exponentially every year and so you can be sure that there is going to be no shortage of jobs in the computer programming industry… Only growth. According to <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the projected job outlook between 2014-2024 is going to be 17%, almost twice the rate of job growth for any other occupation. So, what does that mean for you? Practically a guarantee that you will have a job if you pursue this career, and more importantly that you will get to keep it for a long time. <img src="https://code.org/images/cs-stats/more-jobs-than-students.png" alt="Computer Programming Job and Money Statistics" width="600" height="400" align="center" /></p>

<h2 id="money">4. Money</h2>
<p><img src="http://greenapplefoam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Go-Green-to-Save-Green-with-your-Income-Tax-Return1.jpg" alt="Programming Makes You Money" width="600" height="400" align="center" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You can have everything in life that you want, if you will just help enough other people get what they want”. – Zig Ziglar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now let’s get to the part that you are all here for! <em><a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">The median salary of a computer programmer stands at $47 per hour which means $97,000 per year!</a></em>. Statistically, the <strong>median</strong> is the most robust determinant for averages and if that is coming out to be $47 an hour, you have a very high chance of making that much money AND you will also have the opportunity available for higher compensation than the median.</p>

<p>You will only make money when you can solve other people’s problems and help them achieve their dreams. That is effectively what a job actually is by definition. An entrepreneur who starts his own business is also simply trying to help others reach their goals and in turn those others help the entrepreneur reach his or her goal of financial freedom. Since computer programming has problem solving as one of its main reasons for existing, you can imagine that you will be extremely valuable to many people. You will be an asset that they could bring on board in order to help them digitize their million dollar idea. They will be more than happy to pay you a healthy chunk of money when you help them implement their ideas and turn them into a reality.</p>

<p>As long as there exist people, there will exist problems. As long as there exist problems, there will exist the need for creating solutions. In lieu of that, computer programming will remain relevant indefinitely as it is one of the strongest tools we have currently for problem solving and helping people get what they want.</p>
